    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p class="text1"> I am born and raised in Nairobi.I love sleeping ,eating , the colour purple ,spending time with loved ones and The famous Manchetser United .
        My education began in a primary school named Good Testimony Junior school,located in Nyayo estate Embakasi where I studied for 8 years and later moved to Green Gardens situated in Kikuyu and completed my primary education.
        I then joined Sacho High school which is a mixed boarding school in Baringo county where I completed my secondary education.
     Being a student fresh from high school who has all the time to spare as I await to join university I thought to  myself; Why not use this time wisely and equip myself with knowledge on programming ??
     I am very eager and psyched to learn how to code,to have a skill that most people do not have and be able to use it to make the world a better and easier place to be in ,set aside being very interesting and exciting. </p>
